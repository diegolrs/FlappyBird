# FlappyBird

## A Flappy Bird clone made in Java

### I decide to use the Java Programming Language on Eclipse's IDE because of Java's native features like:

* import java.awt.Color;
* import java.awt.Graphics;
* import java.awt.Rectangle;
* import java.util.Random;

### and the main class was extended by Canvas and implemented by Runnable and KeyListener, anothers Java's natives features.
